A chrome extension for Imgur that skips images you've already seen. Perfect for hardcore Imgurians. You can [download it on the chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seen-it/nmajkegnjcjcjehiindhfldkfeoifeff).

## What does it do?
![Demo](https://j.gifs.com/yXorJo.gif)

Seen It stores the images you see on Imgur and then automatically skips those images if you see them again. There are also options that allow you to disable skipping images, disable storing images, and clear all your stored images.

## Things I want to add
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut to toggle options
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut that disabled skip on key down and then enables skipping again on key up
- [ ] Switch from localstorage to chrome sync
- [ ] Think about how to automatically clear old images if the history gets too large
- [ ] Add tests

## Contact
This is my first chrome extension so let me know if there are ways I can improve the code! You can open an issue, send me a tweet ([@rjun07a](https://twitter.com/rjun07a)), or shoot me an email if you want to get in touch. I'll try to get back to you quickly.
